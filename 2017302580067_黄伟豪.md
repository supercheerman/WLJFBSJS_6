# P40
#### a. the intervals are [1,6] and [23,26]
#### b. the intervals are [6,16] and [17,22]
#### c. packet loss is recognized by a triple duplicate ACK
#### d. segment loss is detected due to timeout
#### e. the threshold is initially 32
#### f. the threshold is 21 during the 18th transmission round
#### g. the threshold is 14
#### h. packet 70 is sent in the 7th transmission round,1+2+4+8+16+32=63+32>70
#### i. the new values of the threshold and window will be 4 and 7 
#### j. threshold is 21, and congestion window size is 1. 
#### k. round 17, 1 packet; round 18, 2 packets; round 19, 4 packets; round 20, 8 packets; round 21, 16 packets; round 22, 21 packets. So, the total number is 52.

#### b.No. In the long run, C1’s bandwidth share is roughly twice as that of C2’s.

# P51
#### a.
![table](https://github.com/supercheerman/Text-Categorization/blob/master/MD8AN2FTB6%7BE%5D%60UQK0%24DFYP.png)
#### b.yes, we can draw the conclusion from the table above.
#### c.yes, the max window size is 2
#### d.no, when the two connection reach the max window size, the segment may be lost.
